                            - if using playground, you can define the cpu/mem usage at backendConfig.
                            - if using inference service, you can define the cpu/mem at the container resources.
                            However, if you define the same accelerator resources at playground/service as well,
                            the resources will be overwritten by the flavor limit here.
