                      PreStop is called immediately before a container is terminated due to an
                      API request or management event such as liveness/startup probe failure,
                      preemption, resource contention, etc. The handler is not called if the
                      container crashes or exits. The Pod's termination grace period countdown begins before the
                      PreStop hook is executed. Regardless of the outcome of the handler, the
                      container will eventually terminate within the Pod's termination grace
                      period (unless delayed by finalizers). Other management of the container blocks until the hook completes
                      or until the termination grace period is reached.

                      a termination signal and the time when the processes are forcibly halted with a kill signal.
                      Set this value longer than the expected cleanup time for your process.
                      If this value is nil, the pod's terminationGracePeriodSeconds will be used. Otherwise, this
                      value overrides the value provided by the pod spec.

                      the kill signal (no opportunity to shut down).
