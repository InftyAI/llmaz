# All Kinds of Supported Inference Backends

If you want to integrate more backends into llmaz, please refer to this [PR](https://github.com/InftyAI/llmaz/pull/182). It's always welcomed.

## llama.cpp

[llama.cpp](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp) is to enable LLM inference with minimal setup and state-of-the-art performance on a wide variety of hardware - locally and in the cloud.

## SGLang

[SGLang](https://github.com/sgl-project/sglang) is yet another fast serving framework for large language models and vision language models.

## Text-Generation-Inference

[text-generation-inference](https://github.com/huggingface/text-generation-inference) is a Rust, Python and gRPC server for text generation inference. Used in production at Hugging Face to power Hugging Chat, the Inference API and Inference Endpoint.

## ollama

[ollama](https://github.com/ollama/ollama) is running with Llama 3.2, Mistral, Gemma 2, and other large language models, based on llama.cpp, aims for local deploy.

## vLLM

[vLLM](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm) is a high-throughput and memory-efficient inference and serving engine for LLMs
